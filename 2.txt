Thank you, Christopher, Michael, Simon, Gershom, and everyone else who
participated these past weeks.

I'm also happy with the progress we made -- but especially with how we made
it. The technical details have unfolded at a maddeningly slow rate, but we
made significant progress at broadening the field of collaboration between
several principle contributors in the community.

We (the committee) are going to continue this process in the future: of using
-community to discuss issues on a broader scale, and myself acting as a sort
of "secretary" between the committee and the community, to ensure everything
is heard and recorded, and nothing is ignored.

Whatever issue people have to discuss, feel free to bring them up here! and
invite others to do so who may have felt in the past that they didn't have a
platform for their concerns.

John
