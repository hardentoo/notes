Hi Ryan, how are things in NYC?  Did you have to endure the juggernaut of
customer complaints as you had feared, after that blackout?

I had a _lot_ of fun there at NYC Hac, and part of the experience was staying
there with you in your apartment.  I usually regard NYC as pretty hectic, but
you provided a cozy and enjoyable place to rest my head.  Thank you so much
for helping me out, you made the trip possible!

I also wanted to ping you about the PostgreSQL stuff, it sounded quite
interesting.  It doesn't have to be in great shape before you send it; I'll
treat it as proprietary source code, and it will not leave my machine, or the
encrypted volume I keep contract source code on.

Talk with you soon,
  John
