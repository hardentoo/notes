I think that in the interests of time, I'm going to close this discussion now
(thanks for all who sent second round votes by e-mail), and will go with the
following order, to be published by Monday:

    Minimal, Stack, HP

We can open follow-on discussions after that to tweak the page with whatever
clarifications or simplifications we feel are necessary.  The only remaining
edits to be applied are the clarifications from Mathieu, and to finish out the
bottom of the page (the third-party stuff).
