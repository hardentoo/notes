Say: My creatures are even as the fish of
the deep. Their life dependeth upon the water, and yet they remain unaware
of that which, by the grace of an omniscient and omnipotent Lord,
sustaineth their very existence. Indeed, their heedlessness is such that
were they asked concerning the water and its properties, they would prove
entirely ignorant.
