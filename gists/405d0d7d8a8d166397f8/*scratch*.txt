Hey John, how are you doing?

I wanted to give you a little update on the downloads page/Stack front: the
downloads page currently links primarily to the minimal installers, which is
contrary to what users voted on, and is not actively harmful

The Stack team is receiving multiple bug reports due to the very out-of-date
version of Stack present in the OS X minimal installer. This is wasting our
time, and was the source of me commenting on Twitter

I have no intention of getting dragged into another multi-week debate on this.
But the only reasonable solution to this problem is to remove the minimal
installers. I'd also say that removing the platform is the only logical move
for that option, since it's clearly not catching up like it was claimed to be
(still no Stack support, still has the harmful global databases, etc)
