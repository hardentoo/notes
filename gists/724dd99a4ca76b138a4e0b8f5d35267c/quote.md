Know thou that when the Son of Man yielded up His breath to God, the whole
creation wept with a great weeping. By sacrificing Himself, however, a fresh
capacity was infused into all created things. Its evidences, as witnessed in
all the peoples of the earth, are now manifest before thee. The deepest wisdom
which the sages have uttered, the profoundest learning which any mind hath
unfolded, the arts which the ablest hands have produced, the influence exerted
by the most potent of rulers, are but manifestations of the quickening power
released by His transcendent, His all-pervasive, and resplendent Spirit.

We testify that when He came into the world, He shed the splendor of His glory
upon all created things. Through Him the leper recovered from the leprosy of
perversity and ignorance. Through Him, the unchaste and wayward were healed.
Through His power, born of Almighty God, the eyes of the blind were opened,
and the soul of the sinner sanctified.

Leprosy may be interpreted as any veil that interveneth between man and the
recognition of the Lord, his God. Whoso alloweth himself to be shut out from
Him is indeed a leper, who shall not be remembered in the Kingdom of God, the
Mighty, the All-Praised. We bear witness that through the power of the Word of
God every leper was cleansed, every sickness was healed, every human infirmity
was banished. He it is Who purified the world. Blessed is the man who, with a
face beaming with light, hath turned towards Him.
