Here are
a few lines from the instructors version of the SF book that gives more
context:

    ===> PLEASE DO NOT DISTRIBUTE THE SOLUTIONS PUBLICLY <===

    ... we ask that these be distributed only locally -- on paper, on a
    password-protected webpage, etc. We've found that, if solutions
    are too easily available, the temptation for students to peek at
    them becomes irresistable, so we want to keep them from getting
    into the wild as much as possible.
