                                  Semigroups

  A semigroup is like a monoid without the requirement of an identity element:
  it consists simply of a set with an associative binary operation....
  
  Of course, any monoid is automatically a semigroup (by forgetting about its
  identity element). In the other direction, to turn a semigroup into a
  monoid, simply add a new distinguished element to serve as the identity, and
  extend the definition of the binary operation appropriately. This creates an
  identity element by definition, and it is not hard to see that it preserves
  associativity....
  
  Adding a new distinguished element to a type is typically accomplished by
  wrapping it in Maybe. One might therefore expect to turn an instance of
  Semigroup into an instance of Monoid by wrapping it in Maybe. Sadly,
  Data.Monoid does not define semigroups, and has a Monoid instance for Maybe
  which requires a Monoid constraint on its argument type...

  This is somewhat odd: in essence, it ignores the identity element of a and
  replaces it with a different one....
