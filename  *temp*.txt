12:51 <hackrilege> E.g. I don't know if this recursive datatype will outperform Date.Map
          in a fold
12:51 <johnw> ok, that's a very relevant question
12:51 <hackrilege> Answer, it's impossible to even begin to understand how to think
          about answering that, can you please benchmark it yourself
12:51 <johnw> benchmarking is the best approach
12:51 <hackrilege> Incorrect
12:52 <johnw> why are you expecting #haskell to come up with an answer without you doing
          the work?
12:52 <hackrilege> It's a question about rationalizing
12:52 <johnw> I'm ending this conversation now, hackrilege.  This is not going anywhere
          and I have work to do.
