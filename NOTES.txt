New command-line options:

  OPTIONS:
  
  -F FILE      FILE is a SQLite3 database related to this query
  -N           do not consider the filesystem, but only the database
               (this causes behavior changes in many options:
                -missing will always be true
                -added, -changed, -mismatch will always be false
                -name and -path become straight SQL queries
                -update is a no-op
                -checksum will report "no data available")
  
  PREDICATES:
  
  -added       file newly added to the filesystem?
  -missing     file no longer on the filesystem?
  -changed     mtime/size (but not checksum) different from db?
  -mismatch    does checksum not match from previous run?
               (this is useful for verifying file integrity, even if the
                modtime and size are identical)
  -hassum      file has checksum information in database?
  -stime n     entry was first seen by db n*24 hours ago?
  -utime n     entry's last db update was n*24 hours ago?
  -total n     file, or dir and all its contents, uses n units of space?
  
  COMMANDS:
  
  -update      update or create info in database
  -remove      remove info from the database
  -checksum    (re-)calculate file checksum (implies -update)

New features:

 - Store filesystem data in a database.  This makes it possible to catalog
   offlined volumes like DVDs, and query their contents later using regular
   find syntax.

 - The ability to descend into "virtual filesystems", such as tarballs, disk
   images (on Mac OS X) and other archive formats.

 - When only the database is being considered (-N), find predicates are
   rewritten as an SQL query.  The makes it possible to use find to catalog
   a large volume, and later do fast queries within it, replacing the need
   for utilities such as locate.
