-- | There are several ways to communicate with the sessions related to a
--   project.  They are:
--
--   ['StartRunning'] You want the most recently compiled state of the project
--   to beginning running.  If an 'irpRunningProcess' is currently running, it
--   is stopped.  The 'irpLoadingProcess' then becomes the 'irpRunningProcess'
--   and is started using 'SP.run'.  We then reload the project (as with
--   'openProject') in a new 'irpLoadingProcess'.
--
--   ['InteractWithRunning'] You want to interact with a running process.  If
--   no process is running, start the process as with 'StartProcess'.  Then,
--   or if the process was already running, communicate with the
--   'irpRunningProcess'.
--
--   ['InteractWithCurrentlyRunning'] You want to interact with a running
--   process, but only if one is currently running.  If not, fail.
--
--   ['InteractWithLoading'] Interact with the current 'irpLoadingProcess'.
--   There is always an 'irpLoadingProcess', although it may currently be in a
--   compiling state, so the interaction will block until it is ready.
