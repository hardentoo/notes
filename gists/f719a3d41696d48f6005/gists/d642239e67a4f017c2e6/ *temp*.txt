14:41 <relrod> going to link the haskell-infra/ansible repo to phabricator. Not moving
          it to phabricator hosting for now, just linking it to the github one.
14:56 <thoughtpolice> relrod: just saw, cool
14:56 <thoughtpolice> D1
14:56 <phaskell> D1: Add LICENSE and update README.md -
          https://phabricator.haskell.org/D1
14:57 <thoughtpolice> relrod: BTW, two things
14:57 <thoughtpolice> relrod: check on phabricator.haskell.org - look at /opt/update.sh,
          and /opt/phabricator/resources/chatbot/phaskell.json
14:58 <thoughtpolice> those two files should be saved somewhere, perhaps in the repo
14:58 <thoughtpolice> the first is a convenient update script, the second is the Chatbot
          config
14:58 <thoughtpolice> actually I think the second contains the phaskell pass...
14:58 <relrod> hm ok
14:59 <relrod> thoughtpolice: did you just run update.sh btw?
14:59 <relrod> (is that why phaskell quit?)
15:00 <thoughtpolice> yes
15:00 <thoughtpolice> i was mostly testing it
15:00 <thoughtpolice> that's also why there were a lot of joins/parts earlier
15:00 <thoughtpolice> relrod: it's also convenient since 'phd start' doesn't start
          Chatbot, we have to manually start that daemon
15:00 <thoughtpolice> dunno if there's an option somewhere to fix that
15:00 <relrod> thoughtpolice: I am trying to see how to make the UI all pretty like
          secure.phabricator.com is now
15:01 <relrod> it's all... light and pretty :P
15:01 <thoughtpolice> i know!
15:01 <thoughtpolice> i saw that
15:01 <thoughtpolice> i wanted it too, that's why I updated :P
15:02 <thoughtpolice> relrod: we should add an .arcconfig to the repo too, but i'll try
          to do that this time
15:02 <thoughtpolice> and submit it with arc, etc
15:02 <thoughtpolice> relrod: i updated the arcanist nix expr, btw. i'll probably keep
          that one and the phab deployment in sync
15:02 <relrod> thoughtpolice: I was looking at how to do that (I didn't know if it was
          still manual or if there was an arc command for it). I googled and that is how
          I saw the new theme on s.p.c
15:03 <thoughtpolice> ah
15:03 <relrod> thoughtpolice: Ok...if I run the update then I'll submit a PR for the nix
          expr then
15:03 <relrod> since I don't have commit access there yet :(
15:03 <thoughtpolice> *nod*
15:04 <relrod> I sent a PR the other day to add purescript, but it hasn't been merged
          yet
15:04 <relrod> thoughtpolice: that is one thing I noticed about nixpkgs, they are slow
          to merge things. Not sure if it's intentional (to give people time to test
          things) or just not enough people to keep tabs on the PRs.
15:05 <relrod> or a mix of the two
15:05 <thoughtpolice> it's mostly #2 I think
15:05 <thoughtpolice> there's no like dedicated reviewer cycle... i haven't merged
          anything because i've been gone the past week
15:05 * relrod nods
15:07 <relrod> thoughtpolice: when do you plan on moving the wiki db over to mysql01?
15:09 <thoughtpolice> not sure yet
15:09 <thoughtpolice> one thing is that it will slow it down quite a lot, while the wiki
          is still hosted on Rock
15:09 <relrod> yeah, it might
15:09 <thoughtpolice> because it'll be communicating from ~Germany to ~North Virginia
15:09 * relrod nods
15:10 <relrod> thoughtpolice: time for wiki01 at rackspace? :)
15:11 <thoughtpolice> probably, yeah
15:12 <thoughtpolice> oh snap, 'arc diff' in the nix pkg is slightly broken...
15:13 * thoughtpolice tries to fix
15:14 <relrod> thoughtpolice: I just added my ssh pubkey to all regions in rackspace. I
          won't have time until late next week or so, but if you spin up a wiki01 box
          with the specs you, want maybe next weekend I can ansible the wiki setup (sans
          db password ... that should be interesting) and get that box set up
15:14 <relrod> which reminds me
15:15 <relrod> thoughtpolice: I'll be in CO on the 1st - 5th, so I won't be around as
          much. I'll have internet most days but I'll be a bit busy doing Fedora stuff
          ;)
15:15 <relrod> s/you, want/you want,/
15:16 <relrod> or tell me the specs you want and I can spin the box up when I get a
          chance.
15:17 <thoughtpolice> relrod: k
15:17 <thoughtpolice> also, i just submitted D2
15:17 <phaskell> D2: Add .arcconfig - https://phabricator.haskell.org/D2
15:17 <thoughtpolice> relrod: `arc diff` will submit diffs to Diffusion for you
15:19 <relrod> thoughtpolice: yep, used it
15:19 <relrod> I think "arc land" will push things out correctly too
15:20 <thoughtpolice> yeah
15:20 <relrod> when a review is accepted
15:21 <thoughtpolice> relrod: how do i accept D1? and also, is there a way to list open
          pending reviews I need to look at from arc?
15:21 <phaskell> D1: Add LICENSE and update README.md -
          https://phabricator.haskell.org/D1
15:23 <thoughtpolice> ah, I see, at the bottom
15:23 <relrod> `arc list` will list pending, if you run it in a clone
15:23 <thoughtpolice> that only lists your pending diffusion changes
15:23 <thoughtpolice> not ones e.g. i need to review
15:23 <thoughtpolice> or at least, 'arc list' does not list D1 for me, only D2, because
          i submitted it
15:23 <relrod> oh :(
15:25 <thoughtpolice> relrod: OK, if you're using nixpkgs arc, probably want to update
          to latest
15:25 <thoughtpolice> I just fixed it
15:25 * relrod uses arc from upstream git
15:25 <relrod> which reminds me
15:25 <relrod> thoughtpolice: what does "arc upgrade" do for you?
15:25 <relrod> does it break your nixpkgs thing?
15:26 <thoughtpolice> it probably doesn't work at all
15:26 <thoughtpolice> the nix store is read only, so i doubt it can even do anything
15:26 <thoughtpolice> the .git repo is stripped too
15:26 <relrod> hah
15:26 <thoughtpolice> but that's fine with me
15:26 <thoughtpolice> relrod: but yeah, we should figure out how to get that nice new
          theme :)
15:27 * relrod is trying
15:27 <relrod> I keep getting distracted ;P
15:28 <thoughtpolice> relrod: nice, arc land works great :)
15:28 <thoughtpolice> very convenient
15:38 <thoughtpolice> relrod: the odd thing is i don't see anything recent in their git
          repo for this change...
15:38 <relrod> thoughtpolice: yeah, same... maybe ask #phabricator?
15:44 <relrod> thoughtpolice: oh hang on
15:45 <relrod> thoughtpolice: https://github.com/phacility/phabricator/tree/redesign
15:45 <relrod> flip to that branch
15:46 <thoughtpolice> relrod: ahhh, i see
15:48 <relrod> thoughtpolice: I have to head out
15:48 <relrod> back a bit later
15:48 <thoughtpolice> k
17:28 <thoughtpolice> johnw: boom
          https://www.rackspace.com/blog/cloud-images-for-the-open-cloud-import-export-and-share-images/
17:28 <thoughtpolice> http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/images/
17:33 <johnw> thoughtpolice: linode's prices are very attractive for running a NixOS box
          there
17:33 <johnw> for $20 it beats what I'm getting for $15 at serveraxis
17:33 <johnw> double the memory, quadruple the disk space
17:33 <johnw> and Mark is running NixOS there!
17:33 <thoughtpolice> yeah several people are doing it
17:34 <johnw> i think I'll switch after the craziness of June
17:34 <thoughtpolice> ocharles was as well i think
18:40 <ocharles> I run NixOS there
18:45 <johnw> ocharles: are the wiki instructions up-to-date?
18:46 <ocharles> johnw: more or less, yea
18:52 <relrod> hi
18:55 <relrod> thoughtpolice: ping
18:59 <relrod> thoughtpolice: I switched us to the redesign branch of phabricator - I
          can't run update.sh because I don't know where you put the root mysql pw :P
18:59 <relrod> but I updated it so it won't switch us back to master next time its run
22:38 <thoughtpolice> relrod: nice
22:44 <thoughtpolice> johnw: ping
22:44 <johnw> I have answered your summons, lord
22:45 <thoughtpolice> johnw: have you signed up for Phab yet? i don't think you have
22:45 <johnw> no
22:45 <johnw> phab hasn't entered my radar as yet
22:45 <thoughtpolice> you should try it, me and relrod are starting to use it a bit to
          organize stuff
22:45 <thoughtpolice> I think it's quite good as an issue board for us to keep track of
          things
22:45 <johnw> i'll try it mid-June
22:46 <johnw> tonight I want to get xetex building on Mac if I can, and to get postfix
          running in a NixOS VM
22:49 <thoughtpolice> ah, OK
22:50 <thoughtpolice> i just filed a Phabricator task for NixOS on rackspace, actually
          :)
22:50 <thoughtpolice> phaskell: T4
22:50 <phaskell> T4: Get a NixOS image on Rackspace - https://phabricator.haskell.org/T4
22:52 <johnw> tasty
22:53 <johnw> get me a cheap beta machine!
22:58 <thoughtpolice> johnw: you can make one yourself! just use rackspace
22:58 <thoughtpolice> 1) Create Ubuntu (or whatever VM)
22:58 <thoughtpolice> 2) Install Nix
22:59 <johnw> i mean, I want one to run my personal website on that cost <$20/month
22:59 <thoughtpolice> 3) Build NixOS images on there, upload back to Rackspace
22:59 <thoughtpolice> oh :)
22:59 <johnw> having my own stuff on NixOS would drive me to learn it even beter
22:59 <thoughtpolice> Hetzner is probably the cheapest host atm
22:59 <thoughtpolice> you can get a Hetzner VQ9 or VQ12 for like $10 or $15 I think
22:59 <johnw> linode
22:59 <johnw> ah
22:59 <johnw> and run NixOS on it?
22:59 <thoughtpolice> Hetzner has direct sypport for NixOps
22:59 <thoughtpolice> *support
22:59 <thoughtpolice> so it can magically deploy for you
23:00 <johnw> VQ12 has half the memory of the linode equivalent
23:00 <thoughtpolice> I manage two machines with NixOps: bare-metal EX40 (32GB RAM, 2TB
          HDD, 8 cores), and a VQ9
23:03 <johnw> my goal is to move my web server and my file server to NixOS, and manage
          them with NixOps, by the end of the summer
23:06 <johnw> thoughtpolice: I've invited ryantrinkle
23:06 <johnw> he has an interesting idea for us
23:07 <ryantrinkle> so, johnw just told me that you guys are switching to nix
23:07 <ryantrinkle> at skedge.me, we recently hired a guy to do nix devops full time
23:07 <ryantrinkle> our whole backend stack is haskell-based
23:07 <ryantrinkle> so i figured it might make sense to collaborate
23:08 <johnw> he may have stepped away for a moment
23:08 <johnw> but he's a late-nighter, so he'll be back
23:08 <ryantrinkle> no problem
23:09 <johnw> I think collaboration makes a lot of sense; what form did you have in
          mind?
23:09 <ryantrinkle> nothing, yet
23:09 <ryantrinkle> we just started doing test deployments with nixops, so perhaps we
          could help you guys out
23:09 <ryantrinkle> (if we're at all ahead in that department)
23:09 <johnw> so, we're using rackspace right now
23:09 <johnw> and talking to them about getting backend support for rackspace into
          NixOps
23:09 <ryantrinkle> ah, we're all AWS-based
23:09 <johnw> thoughtpolice: has been working on that code actually
23:10 <ryantrinkle> cool
23:10 <johnw> and rackspace apparently wants to get into Haskell much more
23:10 <ryantrinkle> well, nixops seems quite good at cross-datacenter stuff
23:10 <ryantrinkle> that's great
23:10 <johnw> let me see if bitemyapp is on
23:10 <ryantrinkle> how might they do that/
23:10 <thoughtpolice> sorry i was filing tickets
23:10 <thoughtpolice> see johnw, that's why you should just register for phab and at
          least let me CC you on this stuff :P
23:11 <johnw> bitemyapp lives near thoughtpolice, and has been talking with rackspace
          about Haskell and Nix
23:11 <johnw> thoughtpolice: phab URL again?
23:11 <thoughtpolice> https://phabricator.haskell.org
23:11 <thoughtpolice> bonus: Github/google/anything oauth if you want it easy
23:11 <thoughtpolice> or not, whatever
23:11 <johnw> I've invited in bitemyapp, he's on
23:12 <bitemyapp> hullo hullo.
23:12 <bitemyapp> does Done log this channel?
23:12 <bitemyapp> so I can catch-up.
