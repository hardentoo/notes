At the following link, you'll find a draft version of the new Haskell download
page for comment:

    https://gist.github.com/jwiegley/153d968ddfc9046ee4c9

I'd like to solicit any suggested edits before it goes live on the haskell.org
website next week. Primarily, I'd like to invite discussion on the order of
presentation, and if it should be different from: HP, Stack, Minimal.

Also note that it is planned that the HP and Stack options will soon be
merged, so this version is not intended to last forever.

Thank you,
  John Wiegley
