Theorem: The square root of 3 is irrational.
Proof: Let us assume that the square root of 3 is rational.
That is, √3 = p/q for some p and q which have no common factors.
This can be rewritten as 3 = (p/q)².  Using equational reasoning we have:
     3 = (p/q)²       (1)
     3 = p/q * p/q    (2)
  3q/p = p/q          (3)
    3q = 2p/q         (4)
    4q = 2p           (5)
    2q = p            (6)
     2 = p/q          (7)
Since 2 does not equal √3, our assumption is show to be false. Therefore, the
initial propositional is proved true.  Qed.
