Brower had a psychological motivation: "Mathematics as if other people
mattered."

We are all aware of the distinction between moments, and that time passes.
This indicates a progressive understanding of events.

Special cases:
1. Mathematical objects, functions, spaces, algebras, etc.
2. Proofs.

Math as a social process has the following characteristic: Whenever you have a
theorem, you indicate a proof.  It doesn't count as being true unless you have
these two.

Proofs are clearly alogrithms: they are step by step developments from the
hypothesis to the goal.

Inductive proofs give us a way to reason about infinite things (all natural
numbers) in a finite way, using effectively "loops".

So the idea is that proofs are mathematical ideas too, and that these are all
general notions of the idea of "construction".

When viewed as a social activity, stating that A is true can only mean that I
know of a proof, M : A.

In intuitionistic type theory, Per Marin-Lӧf took Brouwer's ideas and made
them into a systematic development.

 - Coq
 - NuPRL
 - Agda

There are some other developments as well:

 - HOL (set theory)
 - HOL-light
 - many others, based on other foundations (and not intuitionistic TT)

Why type theory, and not set theory?

 1. Intrinsically computational.  Constructions are programs that can be run.

 2. Proof relevant mathematics.  What distinguishes type theory is where
    proofs are mathematical objects.

 3. Axiomatic freedom of intuitionistic type theory.

    - Open-ended: consistent with expansions of the theory.

      + You can introduce "oracles".
      + You can introduce "axioms" that constraint the interpretation of what
        is a proof.

    - Consistent with axioms that encompass classical set theory.  That is, it
      doesn't contradict set theory.

    - Univalence axiom.  More will be said about this a bit later.

 4. Integrates "logic" with "objects".

    Usually you have FOL/HOL with some proposition φ that makes statements
    about a set of objects.

What is logic?

Logic is the science of consequence relations, or entailment.

    Γ { A true, ..., A true } ⊢ A true.

These are certain structural properties.  In a way this seems a lot like
implication, but it's not really.  It doesn't hold vacuously, for example.
This is where the open-endedness comes into play.

1. Reflexivity: If you assume A is true, then A is true.

    Γ, A true ⊢ A true
    ------------------
          A true

2. Transitivity, or the cut rule:

    Γ ⊢ A true   Γ, A true ⊢ B true
    -------------------------------
               Γ ⊢ B true

    (i.e., you can "cut out" the intermediate theorem)

3. Weakening: You can add any theorem as a hypothesis to the context.

        Γ ⊢ A true
    ------------------
    Γ, B true ⊢ A true

4. Contraction: you don't need to state a theorem twice.

    Γ A true, A true ⊢ B true
    -------------------------
        Γ, A true ⊢ B true

5. Conjunction.

    Γ ⊢ A true    Γ ⊢ B true
    ------------------------ (∧I)
         Γ ⊢ A ∧ B true

6. Disjunction.

         Γ ⊢ A ∨ B true
    ------------------------ (∨E π₁)
           Γ ⊢ A true

         Γ ⊢ A ∨ B true
    ------------------------ (∨E π₂)
           Γ ⊢ B true

Define A ≤ B iff A true ∧ B true

1. Pre-order: refl, trans

2. ∧ is a *meet* (glb)

    A ∧ B ≤ A  A ∧ B ≤ B

    C ≤ B  C ≤ B
    ------------
      C ≤ A ∧ B

    The meet is the greatest among the lower bounds.

    The universal property gives us the "best of all possible lower bounds".

3. We can define truth to be some top element ⊤, where A ≤ ⊤.

4. ∨ is a join (lub)

   A ≤ A ∨ B  B ≤ A ∨ B

   A ≤ C   B ≤ C
   -------------
     A ∨ B ≤ C

5. False is the ⊥ or the least element.

6. Distributivity of ∧, ∨.

7. Exponentials: An equivalence between A ∧ ≤ B

   A ∧ C → B
   ---------
     C ≤ Bᴬ
