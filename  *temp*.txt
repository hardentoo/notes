I'm trying to build fpco in an Ubuntu virtual machine so that I can try a "full deployment environment" locally, rather than debugging on QA.

I have wiped my local Cabal library, wiped my hsenv, and did a fresh clone of fpco. But whenever I try to build-all.sh, it fails building Cabal-ide-backend. For example:

fpco:~/fpco/ide-backend/vendor/cabal/Cabal {(no branch)} $ cabal install
Resolving dependencies...
Failed to install Cabal-ide-backend-1.16.0.3.1
cabal: Error: some packages failed to install:
Cabal-ide-backend-1.16.0.3.1 failed during the configure step. The exception
was:
ExitFailure 127
fpco:~/fpco/ide-backend/vendor/cabal/Cabal {(no branch)} [1] $ 
Do you have any ideas what is going on?
