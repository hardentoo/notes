(* This rather excessively complicated, dependent fold function is needed in
   order to walk through a list of intervals of a [ScanState] (which have a
   type dependent on that [ScanState]), while at the same time mutating the
   same [ScanState] and adjusting the type of the remainder of the interval
   list, such that it is known to still have a relationship with the new
   [ScanState].  See the function [checkActiveIntervals] in Allocate.v, which
   is the only user of this function. *)
