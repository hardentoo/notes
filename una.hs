-- A simple universal unarchiving utility.  Just point it at any archive or
-- compressed file, and it spits out a single file or directory in the current
-- directory with its contents.  Use -d to delete the original archive on
-- success.  Use -f to overwrite any existing file or directory which might be
-- in the way.
--
-- To handle all the supported formats on Mac OS X, you must first install:
--   sudo port install cabextract unarj unrar lha p7zip

-- This script takes a series of pathnames to compressed files and/or
-- archives, and uncompresses/decodes/unarchives them.
--
-- What's especially useful about this script is that it guarantees that the
-- result of this process is a single new entry in the current directory,
-- whether that be a file or a directory.  That is:
--
--   1. If it's simply a compressed file, it uncompresses in the current
--      directory.
--   2. If it's an archive containing a single file or directory, the result
--      is the same as if it had been compressed: the file or directory
--      ends up in the current directory.
--   3. If the archive contains multiple items, they are unarchived in a
--      directory named after the original file.
