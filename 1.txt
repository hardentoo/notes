Mathematics underlies many concepts in computing; this harmony is even
stronger in the domain of functional programming, whose roots lies in the
lambda calculus -- an idea originally developed as a foundation for
mathematics itself.  In this workshop we will cover abstractions that are
directly applicable to everyday programming, and investigate how math can
bring clarity and soundness to the way we approach software design.
