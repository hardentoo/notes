The functional programming community is a place where people of many
backgrounds may unite in a common interest. For this to happen, everyone must
feel welcome, and that their unique positions are respected and encouraged. No
matter what language, framework, or paradigm a person uses, LambdaConf should
be a place for sharing ideas and pursuing the united goal of furthering
functional computing.

At the same time technical interests are to be respected, the individuals who
express those interests must be as well. If there are perceived biases along
lines of gender, age, nationality, or any other preference, it creates
unnecessary division and promotes the comfort of one group against that of
another.

Inviting a speaker with outspoken opinions against the very character of other
attendees sends a mixed message: That the freedoms of one person may be held
above the rights of others, and that opinions are supported which actually
denigrate other attendees.

We ask that Curtis Yarvin's offer to speak at this year's conference be
withdrawn, in order to send the message that his racial views are not
insignificant compared to his technical views, and that the goal of a united
atmosphere is impossible unless every attendee is respected, whether
explicitly and implicitly.
