<leo2007> johnw: I would like to try your clang-tags, but I don't know how to
          compile it.
<johnw> have you run cmake?                                             [07:05]
<leo2007> I did
<johnw> and you ran cmake?
<johnw> i mean, make?
<leo2007> It seems to require clang 3.1
<johnw> yep, indeed it does                                             [07:06]
<leo2007> I have Apple clang version 3.1 (tags/Apple/clang-318.0.61)
<johnw> that's not clang 3.1
<johnw> that's Apple Clang 3.1
<johnw> you have to download the llvm/clang 3.1 release tarballs
<johnw> from the Clang project
<johnw> fortunately, Clang is easy to build and install
<johnw> then run cmake like this: cmake
        -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER:PATH=/usr/local/stow/clang-3.1/bin/clang++ 
                                                                        [07:07]
<johnw> for example
<johnw> oh, and a "." at the end, of course
<pcompassion> i wonder if you could debug ios(xcode based) project in emacs..?
<johnw> why not?                                                        [07:08]
<pcompassion> johnw: that was to me?
<johnw> correct
<pcompassion> wow .. i thought that was impossible                      [07:09]
<johnw> you can call gdb; Xcode just uses gdb
<pcompassion> yeah that i Know, and i tried, but didn't know how to do it
<johnw> run Xcode, then debug, then use ps axwwww to find the gdb invocation
        it's using
<leo2007> johnw: do you have a standalone executable clang-tags to share?
                                                                        [07:10]
<johnw> for Lion?
<leo2007> Lion or snow leopard                                          [07:11]
<johnw> my current version is built against the address-sanitizer
<johnw> lete me rebuild without
<leo2007> johnw: thanks
<pcompassion> johnw: and then?                                          [07:12]
<johnw> pcompassion: invoke that in Emacs
<Gildas> ,more                                                          [07:13]
<fsbot> [2] at http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?Circe
<leo2007> johnw: this is not your site: http://johnwiegley.com/, right?
                                                                        [07:14]
<Gildas> bremner: nor where to find such a piece of advice, apart from here
         elsetime ? the mailing list maybe ?
<johnw> leo2007: it is one of them                                      [07:15]
<johnw> leo2007: the technical site is newartisans.com
<bremner> Gildas: did you try writing to forcer ? 
<leo2007> johnw: apparently that one is ranked in front of the second
<Gildas> bremner: not, who is that ? 
<bremner> the author
<johnw> leo2007: http://ftp.newartisans.com/pub/clang-tags.xz
<johnw> i've posted to johnwiegley.com a lot more recently              [07:16]
<johnw> so, to use clang-tags your project must provide a json build database
<johnw> cmake can generate this automatically
<johnw> but if not, here's an example:
<Gildas> forcer: i'm looking forwards to hook notifications on channel
         activity in circe
<johnw> https://gist.github.com/2941192                                 [07:17]
<johnw> (that's from my current Ledger build)
<johnw> then call: clang-tags <path to dir containing compile_commands.json>
        <source paths...>
<pcompassion> johnw: please bear with me, i really want to get this right.. i
              did ps and got
              /Developer/Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/usr/libexec/gdb/gdb-i386-apple-darwin
              --arch i386 --interp=mi1 -q .. this doesn't have any project
              information.. how do i run the program from here?
<johnw> did you do ps axwwwwwww?
<pcompassion> ps axwwww
<johnw> ok, then type M-x gdb                                           [07:18]
<leo2007> johnw: thanks, I am reading them.
<johnw> and give that whole same command
<pcompassion> johnw: yes i did that
<pcompassion> after that?
<johnw> oops, the clang-tags I built you doesn't do any database creation
<johnw> ask me in a day or two and I'll get you another one
<johnw> pcompassion: after that, set breakpoints in your code and go
<johnw> time for me to hit the hey now
<johnw> good night all!                                                 [07:19]
<pcompassion> how do i go?
<pcompassion> johnw: plz
<johnw> run
<leo2007> johnw: thanks. I will try this one first.
<johnw> night
<leo2007> night
