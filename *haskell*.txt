    Could not deduce (Functor (Context d d))
      arising from the superclasses of an instance declaration
    from the context (c ~ d)
      bound by the instance declaration at traversal.hs:13:10-39
    Possible fix:
      add an instance declaration for (Functor (Context d d))
    In the instance declaration for `Comonad (Context c d)'

    from the context (Functor (Context c d), c ~ d)
      bound by the instance declaration at traversal.hs:13:10-39
      `a' is a rigid type variable bound by
          the type signature for extract :: Context c d a -> a
          at traversal.hs:14:3
    In the return type of a call of `f'
    In the first argument of `runIdentity', namely `(f Identity)'
    In the expression: runIdentity (f Identity)
