 - Q: Whenever I try to use the Python support, I get a segfault

   A: Make sure that the boost_python library you linked against is using the
      exact same Python as the Ledger executable.  In particular I see this
      bug on OS X systems where boost_python is linked against the default
      Python, while Ledger is linked against the version provided by MacPorts.

      Solution: Use one or the other.  If you prefer the system Python, run
      "port deactivate -f python26", to get MacPorts' version out of the way.
      You'll then need to delete the Ledger binary and run "make" to relink
      it.
