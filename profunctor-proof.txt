Theorem: rmap is equal to fmap for any Profunctor P.

Proof:

    data Foo a b = Foo a b
    
    instance Profunctor Foo where
        rmap :: (a -> b) -> Foo c a -> Foo c b
        rmap f (Foo x y) = Foo x (f y)
    class Functor where
        fmap :: (a -> b) -> f a -> f b

    instance Functor (Profunctor c) where fmap :: (a -> b) -> P c a -> P c b
        fmap = rmap
